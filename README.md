# docker-scala-sbt

A docker file set up with a development environment such that you can run SBT easily on Windows.

This requires installing WSL and Docker for Windows, and then running through the tweaks necessary to make Docker happy.

This is because SBT requires a bunch of cache resolution, even if you already have a warmed up Artifactory install, and so providing a pre-built Docker image lets you skip all of that.

## Installing

Install WSL, Docker for Windows and the integration (running Docker from inside a WSL prompt):

## Artifactory

Set up Artifactory.  I did it on the host, you may have better luck running it in a docker container, where Docker can link to it more easily.

Note that Artifactory 5 has the service installer broken on Windows 10, and you need to follow this video to install it:

Artifactory has two things you need to worry about: remote repositories (which are things like Sonatype Releases, JCenter etc) and virtual repositories (which are composites of remote repositories).  You want to create all the Maven remote repositories and turn them into one Maven virtual repository.  Then you want to create all the Ivy virtual repositories and turn them into one Ivy virtual repository.  You do this through the admin interface.

There's some [sbt documentation](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Proxy-Repositories.html#Proxying+Ivy+Repositories) about the dangers of mixing maven and ivy repositories:

> The most common mistake made when setting up a proxy repository for sbt is the attempting to merge both maven and ivy repositories into the same proxy repository. While some repository managers will allow this, itâ€™s not recommended to do so.

If you're publishing to the Artifactory instance, I think you need different repositories for that, but I'm not sure.

I don't remember the list of URLs that I put into artifactory -- I think I just spammed links until everything resolved.  The likely candidates are commented out in the relevant dockerfile, but there's also some scala-sbt repository I haven't been able to track down.

Once you have that up, then the Dockerfile will write to ~/.sbt/repositories with the correct name and the correct IP address.  You will still need to set `-Dsbt.override.build.repos=true` to use the proxy, and then it completely replaces the resolution.

## Building

All the images are available under the images directory:

```
cd images
./build-docker.sh
```

## Running

Using the scripts, all of the containers are transient (they are deleted as soon as they are shut down).  You should mount an external directory to your workspace so that you can save changes there.

Open up a shell:

```
./bin/run-playframework.sh
```

and try to create a project:

```
sbt new playframework/play-scala-seed.g8 --name=test-project
cd test-project
sbt test
```

If you can do that without SBT resolving anything, then you're good.

### Prebuild m2 directory

This may be a nicer solution which does not involve 15 minutes of rebuilding images.  I don't think it's quite as bad as he says, because you can layer Docker images on top of each other, so you'd typically do Scala / Akka / Play builds.
